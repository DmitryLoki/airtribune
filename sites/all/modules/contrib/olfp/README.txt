OpenLayers Feature Popups.
--------------------------
OpenLayers Feature Popups is an extension for the JS library OpenLayers.
Created by Xavier Mamano, OL FeaturePopups wraps the management of popups
and SelectFeature control of OpenLayers.

Requirements
------------
 * OpenLayers Feature Popups: https://github.com/jorix/OL-FeaturePopups

I've bundled the v1.0.0 with the module so, you don't need to download
anything.
If you want, you can use your own version of the library, just clone it in
sites/all/libraries/OL-FeaturePopups and the module will automatically
pick this version if available.

Compatibility with OpenLayers releases:
---------------------------------------
The module works with OpenLayers module >= 7.x-2.x.
Be aware that you need to use a correct OL library version, 2.11, 2.12 or
development version.
