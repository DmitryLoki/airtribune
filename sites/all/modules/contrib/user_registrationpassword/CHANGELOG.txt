User Registration Password 7.x-1.3 2012-09-12
---------------------------------------------
- Feature request: Translatable Confirmation E-Mail - By kle - http://drupal.org/node/1321998
- New: The correct configuration options are set from the 1.3 release and higher during install. No need to configure anything from now on.
- New: The default 'Account activation' e-mail template will be overridden during installation, now it makes a lot more sense.
- Renamed the user_registrationpassword variable to user_registrationpassword_registration, so we can actually remove it correctly via the uninstaller.
- Minor edit to the e-mail template.
- Small change in the logic, we used to check for the role of a user (if admin perms) before we called the submit handler, we now only check if the uid < 1. This fixes a minor possible issue. This module should only work if an anonymous user tries to register. This also made #1773430 unnecessary.
- Added an update function to update the variable names that changed.
- Added CHANGELOG.txt so people can check at all times what changed, even if d.o. is down. (for maintenance for example)
- Updated README.txt to reflect changes and remove wrong / unclear documentation.
